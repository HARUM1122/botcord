# Let's understand the meaning of jihad first.
# Jihad is an arabic word which means to struggle or strive.

# There are mainly two types of jihad,
# 1: Jihad al akbar (the greater jihad)
# 2: Jihad Al Asghar (the lesser jihad)

# Jihad al akbar means struggle to be a better person. Which means if one is trying to be a better person and adhering to the principles of Islam, then he's doing Jihad Al Akbar.

# Jihad Al Asghar means to defend Islam. Now by defending Islam doesn't necessarily means to go and forcefully convert others to Islam, or to go and k!ll innocent non-believers in the name of Islam. FYI, it's the second biggest sin in Islam to take the life of an innocent, be it a Muslim or a Non-muslim.
# Jihad Al Asghar is basically like a w*ar against those who a*ttack you, BUT UNDER SOME STRICT RULES,

# And here are the rules of War in Islam which i doubt that your own army follow jinko tum log full support dete ho,

# 1: K*!lling women and children is prohibited.
# Here are some references from Malik's Muwatta, book no 21,

# Book 21, Number 21.3.8:
# Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that a son of Kab ibn Malik (Malik believed that ibn Shihab said it was Abd ar-Rahman ibn Kab) said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade those who fought ibn Abi Huqayq (a treacherous jew from Madina) to k!ll women and children. He said that one of the men f*!ghting had said, 'The wife of ibn Abi Huqayq began screaming and I repeatedly raised my sword against her. Then I would remember the prohibition of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so I would stop. Had it not been for that, we would have been rid of her."    

# Book 21, Number 21.3.9:
# Yahya related to me from Malik from Nafi from Ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw the c*orpse of a woman who had been slain in one of the raids, and he disapproved of it and forbade the k*illing of women and children.

# Next references are in PART TWO.


# PART TWO,
# This is not only prohibiting the k*illings of women and children, but also prohibiting from Cutting down fruit-bearing trees, prohibiting from destroying an inhabited place, prohibiting from s*laughtering sheeps and camels (EXCEPT FOR FOOD), and so on. You can read it by yourself in the given reference,
# Book 21, Number 21.3.10:

# Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq was sending armies to ash-Sham. He went for a walk with Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan who was the commander of one of the battalions. It is claimed that Yazid said to Abu Bakr, "Will you ride or shall I get down?" Abu Bakrsaid, "I will not ride and you will not get down. I intend these steps of mine to be in the way of Allah."

# Then Abu Bakr advised Yazid, "You will find a people who claim to have totally given themselves to Allah. Leave them to what they claim to have given themselves. You will find a people who have shaved the middle of their heads, s*trike what they have shaved with the sword.

# "I advise you ten things: Do not k*ill women or children or an aged, infirm person. Do not cut down fruit-bearing trees. Do not destroy an inhabited place. Do 
# not s*laughter sheep or camels except for food. Do not burn bees and do not scatter them. Do not steal from the booty, and do not be cow*ardly."


# Book 21, Number 21.3.11:
# Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz wrote to one of his governors, "It has been passed down to us that when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent out a raiding party, he would say to them, 'Make your raids in the name of Allah in the way of Allah. Fight whoever denies Allah. Do not steal from the booty, and do not act treacherously. Do not mutilate and do not k*ill children.' Say the same to your armies and raiding parties, Allah willing. Peace be upon you."

# IN PART THREE, I'LL PROVIDE SOME REFERENCES FROM QURAN AND SAHIH BUKHARI




# PART THREE,
# I'll keep this reply brief. You can checkout the full references by yourself,

# Sahih al-Bukhari 3014: Don't k*!ll a child,
# Sahih al-Bukhari 2545: Be good to the pr*isoners or s*laves and feed them.
# And here are some from the Quran

# Quran 9:6 (Do not k*ill those who ran away)
# Quran 4:90 (Don't f*!ght those who don't f*!ght and offer peace)
# Now,  here are some more verses of Quran which will prove that forceful conversations are prohibited in Islam and also k!*lling of innocent people whether they are muslims or non Muslims,
# Quran 2:256 (Let there be no c*ompulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly from falsehood.1 So whoever renounces fa*lse gods and
#  believes in Allah has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-knowing)
# Quran 60:9
# (Allah does not forbid you from those who do not f*!ght you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly tow*ard them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.)


# Now to put some more knowledge in your stupid brain, here are some verses which says to only f*!ght those who f*!ght you, NOT THOSE WHO ARE JUST NON MUSLIMS,  
#  Quran (60: 9):
# Allah only forbids you from those who f*!ght you because of religion and e*xpel you from your homes and aid in your e*xpulsion - [forbids] that you make allies of them. And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers.

# Quran 2:190: F*ight in the cause of Allah ˹only˺ against those who wage w*ar against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like t*ransgressors.      


# If you want more verses, i can give you more but here's a simple thing for an !d*iot like you that don't talk about the things that you know nothing about.     

# One more thing, for Muslims, Quran come first. So if Quran says something, then it's an absolute principle for us. And Quran clearly says to f*!ght those who f*!ght you. Quran also says that don't DISRESPECT OTHER RELIGIONS, if you want the reference, i can give you.

# And yes, if a Hadith contradicts with Quran, then that Hadith would be considered invalid. Because as i mentioned earlier, for Muslims, Qur'an comes first, then authentic Hadiths.

# Go and learn what Islamic epistemology is.

# Now before you show me some verses from Quran, kindly go and make some research first. Now i know that your research skills are poor just like you so here's how you can make a research on the verses,
# Understand when that verse was revealed,
# Understand why that verse was revealed,
# And finally, read the most reliable tafsir of that verse. Then come and mention that verse because i know exactly what verses you're going to mention.






# PART FOUR,
# Let's talk about October 7th,

# Yes i do condemn Hamas for doing such thing because some innocent people who had nothing do to with this conflict d*ied.

# But the question is, when Israel k!*lled thousands of innocent children, why you didn't condemn it?

# You shared a post where some Palestinians were happy about October 7th, but why you forgot to mention those Israeli soldiers who feel happy when they k!*ll innocent children? Do you want the concrete proof of it?

# why you forgot to share the post of a father who was holding the dead body of his headless baby?

# Why you forgot to share the video of a mother who was holding the d!ead bodies of her two new born babies in her arms?

# Why you forgot to mention the story of a Palestianian boy who wanted to become a professional foot ball player but he lost both of his legs because of your stupid diaper force who loves to target children?

# Why you forgot to mention the story of a Palestianian father who had to a*mputate his child's arm without anesthesia but unfortunately his child d!ed due to the severe pain?

# Why you didn't mention the fact that more than thousands of children have been k!*lled by your stupid diaper force?

# Why you didn't mention the lies of that diaper force like 'h@mas be*headed 40 babies' ? Which was later proved to be false, why you didn't mention it?

# If you want more, i can give you hundereds of more if you want with concrete proofs. We have video proofs but you people always try to justify it by blaming everything on h@amas.

# you tell me, what those children have to do with the history of Israel and palestine? And the conflict?

# You made the post where you were talking about the history of Israel and palestine. You literally blamed Islam for this conflict without even knowing what Islam actually teaches us, but you never spoke for those innocent children who are being k!*lled daily.

# Unlike you, i do condemn the k!*lling of innocnet children, be it a palestianin children or an Israeli children.


# PART 5,
# Now why you never mentioned it? Because the fact is that you're an ignorant person just like other pi*ssful islamophobes.

# You people blame h@amas for everything but never c*ondemn Israel for once for their w*ar cr*imes.

# Let me put some common sense in your st*upid brain,
# if i p*unch you, you have right to punch me back or even a bit more. And nobody will blame you for p*unching me because i started it first. But if you go and punch my every single friend, my family members, then definitely it would be considered wrong.

# Now why i'm saying this? To help you understand that those innocent children who are being k!lled almost daily have nothing to do with this c*onflict and Israel should be condemed but you people will never condem Israel for such horrible acts.
